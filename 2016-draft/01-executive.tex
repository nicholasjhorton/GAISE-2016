\newthought{The American Statistical Association (ASA)} funded the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Project, which consists of two groups, one focused on K--12 education and one focused on introductory college courses. This report presents the recommendations developed by the college group. 

The report includes a brief history of the introductory college course and summarizes the 1992 report\cite{cobb1} by George Cobb that has been considered a generally accepted set of recommendations for teaching these courses. Results of a survey on the teaching of introductory courses are summarized, along with a description of current versions of introductory statistics courses. We then offer a list of goals for students, based on what it means to be statistically literate. We present six recommendations for the teaching of introductory statistics that build on the previous recommendations from Cobb's report. Our six recommendations include the following:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Emphasize statistical literacy and develop statistical thinking
\item Use real data
\item Stress conceptual understanding, rather than mere knowledge of procedures
\item Foster active learning in the classroom
\item Use technology for developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data
\item Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning
\end{enumerate}

The report concludes with suggestions for how to make these changes and includes numerous examples in the appendices to illustrate details of the recommendations.
