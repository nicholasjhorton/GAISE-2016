\newthought{Well-designed assessment items} help to determine whether students understand key statistical concepts.  Since the original GAISE report was written in 2005, there have been many improvements in the ways that instructors and institutions determine whether students have met the learning outcomes for introductory statistics courses.  

Students value that which is assessed, 
\marginnote{\textit{In general, we want students to interpret results more than we want them to produce results. If we ask a True/False question, we want the student to explain \emph{why} a statement is true or is false, so that we can assess the thinking that lead to the answer chosen. However, sometimes the practicalities of teaching a large class mean that an appropriate exam question might be a multiple choice item that does not ask for explanation.}}
so it is important that we assess student learning in a manner consistent with our stated goals. Good items assess the development of statistical thinking and conceptual understanding, preferably using technology and real data.

Below we present exemplary assessment items, some of which include commentary. We also present a few items that are not strong, with suggestions on how they can be improved. Finally, we present advice on constructing a rubric when assessing a project report or presentation.


\section{\textbf{Examples of Exemplary Assessment Items}}
We begin by providing examples of exemplary assessment items with commentary about the items.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 1}}}
Are metal bands used for tagging harmful to penguins?
Researchers investigated this question with a sample of 100 penguins near Antarctica.  All of these penguins had already been tagged with RFID chips, and the researchers randomly assigned 50 of them to receive a metal band on their flippers in addition to the RFID chip. The other 50 penguins did not receive a metal band. Researchers then kept track of which penguins survived for the 4.5-year study and which did not.  They found that 16 of the 50 penguins with a metal band survived, compared to 31 of the 50 penguins without a metal band.  
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Calculate the difference in the proportions who survived between the two groups.

% > foo <- rbind( a=c(surv=16, died=34), b=c(31, 19) )
% > foo
%  surv died
%a   16   34
%b   31   19
%> fisher.test(foo)
%
	%Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
%
%data:  foo
%p-value = 0.004777
%alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1
%95 percent confidence interval:
 %0.1163071 0.7087760
%sample estimates:
%odds ratio 
 %0.2922797 


\item The p-value for comparing the two group's survival proportions turns out to be 0.005.
Explain (as if to someone who has not studied statistics) what this p-value means: This is the probability of $\ldots$

\item Summarize your conclusion from this p-value.  Be sure to address the issue of causation as well as the issue of significance.  Also justify your conclusion.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 2}}}
Suppose that 20\% of undergraduate students at a university own an iPad and 60\% of graduate students at the university own an iPad.  Is it reasonable to conclude that 40\% (the average of 20\% and 60\%) of all students at the university (undergraduate and graduate students combined) own an iPad?  Explain why or why not, as if to a college student who has not taken a statistics class.


\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 3}}}
Suppose that you take a random sample of 100 houses currently for sale in California.  Does the Central Limit Theorem suggest that a histogram of the house prices in the sample will display an approximately normal distribution?  Explain briefly.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 4}}}
Does everyone who scores below the median on this exam necessarily have a negative z-score for this exam?  Explain.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 5}}}
\marginnote{\textit{Sample solution: For an observational study which assessed the association between coffee drinking and cancer, smoking status could mask (or ``confound") the relationship, since smoking could be associated with both coffee drinking and cancer (see also Appendix D,
Multivariable thinking).}}%
Describe a situation
where a third variable could be masking the relationship between two variables.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 6}}}
Let Y denote the amount a student spends on textbooks for one semester. Suppose Nancy, who is statistically savvy, wants to know how fall, semester 1, and spring, semester 2, compare.  In particular, suppose she is interested in the averages $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.  You may assume that Nancy has taken several statistics courses and knows a lot about statistics, including how to interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.  You have random samples from each semester and are to analyze the data and write a report.  You seek advice from four persons:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item \textbf{Rudd says,} ``Conduct an $\alpha=0.05$ test of $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ and tell Nancy whether you reject $H_0$.''

\item \textbf{Linda says,} ``Report a 95\% confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ .''


\item \textbf{Steve says,} ``Conduct a test of $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ and report to Nancy the \textit{p}-value from the test.''

\item \textbf{Gloria says,} ``Compare $\bar{y}_1$  to $\bar{y}_2$.  If $\bar{y}_1 > \bar{y}_2$,  then test $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 > \mu_2$ using $\alpha =0.05$ and tell Nancy whether you reject $H_0$.  If $\bar{y}_1 < \bar{y}_2$,  then test $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 < \mu_2$ using $\alpha = 0.05$ and tell Nancy whether you reject $H_0$.''
\end{enumerate}

Rank the four pieces of advice from worst to best and explain why you rank them as you do. That is, explain what makes one better than another.


\section{\textbf{Examples of Assessment Items with Problems and Commentary}}
We next give some examples of assessment items with problems and commentary about the nature of the difficulty.

\vspace{8pt}

\textbf{\textit{Assessment items to avoid using on tests: traditional True/False, pure computation without a context or interpretation, items with too much data to enter and compute or analyze, or items that only test memorization of definitions or formulas.}}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 7}}}
A teacher taught two sections \marginnote{\textit{Critique: The teacher has all the population data so there is no need to do statistical inference. In addition, the proposed design has serious flaws in terms of statistical practice.}}of elementary statistics last semester, each with 25 students, one at 8:00 a.m. and one at 4:00 p.m. The means and standard deviations for the final exams were 78 and 8 for the 8:00 a.m. class and 75 and 10 for the 4:00 p.m. class. In examining these numbers, it occurred to the teacher that the better students probably sign up for 8:00 a.m. class. So she decided to test whether the mean final exam scores were equal for her two groups of students. State the hypotheses and carry out the test.

 

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 8}}}
An economist wants to compare \marginnote{\textit{Critique: The question doesn't address the conditions necessary for a \textit{t}-test, and with the small sample sizes, they are almost surely violated here. Salaries are almost surely skewed.}} the mean salaries for male and female CEOs. He gets a random sample of 10 of each and does a \textit{t}-test. The resulting \textit{p}-value is 0.045.
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]

\item State the null and alternative hypotheses.
\item Make a statistical conclusion.
\item State your conclusion in words that would be understood by someone with no training in statistics.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 9}}}
Which of the following gives the definition of a \textit{p}-value?
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\Alph{enumi}.}
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\marginnote{\textit{Critique: None of these answers is quite correct. Answers B and D are clearly wrong; answer A is the level of significance; and answer C would be correct if it continued ``\ldots  or more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.''}}
\item It's the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.
\item It's the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.
\item It's the probability of observing data as extreme as that observed.
\item It's the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
\end{enumerate}



\section{\textbf{Examples Showing Ways to Improve Assessment Items}}
\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 9 (revisited)}}}
Which of the following gives the definition of a \textit{p}-value?
\vspace{8pt}

\noindent\smallcaps{Changed to:} \\
 A randomized trial of the
\marginnote{\textit{Sample solution: If bednets were not associated with malaria prevalence then we'd only be likely to see a result this extreme or more extreme one time out of a thousand.  Therefore we conclude that bednets must be effective in preventing malaria.}}
use of bednets to prevent malaria in sub-Saharan Africa yielded a p-value of 0.001.  Without resorting to jargon, interpret this result in the context of the problem to someone without background knowledge of statistics.

\vspace{8pt}
\textbf{\textit{True/False items, even when well-written, do not provide much information about student knowledge because there is always a 50\% chance of getting the item right without any knowledge of the topic. One approach is to change the items into forced-choice questions with three or more options.}}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 10}}}
The size of the standard deviation of a data set depends on where the center is. True or False\\
\vspace{8pt}

\noindent\smallcaps{Changed to:} \\
 Does the size of the standard deviation of a data set depend on \\ \indent where the center is located?
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=1.5cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Yes, the higher the mean, the higher the standard deviation.
\item Yes, because you have to know the mean to calculate the standard deviation.
\item No, the size of the standard deviation is not affected by the location of the distribution.
\item No, because the standard deviation only measures how the values differ from each other, not how they differ from the mean.
 \end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 11}}}
A correlation of $+1$ is stronger than a correlation of $-1$. True or False\\
\vspace{8pt}

\noindent\smallcaps{Rewritten as:}

A recent article in an educational research journal reports a \\ correlation of  $+0.8$ between math achievement and overall math \\ aptitude. It also reports a correlation of  $-0.8$ between math\\ achievement and a math anxiety test. Which of the following\\ interpretations is the most correct?
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=2cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item The correlation of $+0.8$ indicates a stronger relationship than the correlation of $-0.8$.
\item The correlation of $+0.8$ is just as strong as the correlation of $-0.8$.
\item It is impossible to tell which correlation is stronger.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{\textit{Context is important for helping students see and deal with statistical ideas in real-world situations.}}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 12}}}
Once it is established that X and Y are highly correlated, what type of study needs to be done to establish that a change in X causes a change in Y?\\

\vspace{8pt}
\noindent\smallcaps{A context is added:}

A researcher is studying the relationship between an experimental \\ medicine and T4 lymphocyte cell levels in HIV/AIDS patients. \\ The T4 lymphocytes, a part of the immune system, are found at \\ reduced levels in patients with the HIV infection. Once it is \\ established that the two variables, dosage of medicine, and T4 cell \\ levels are highly correlated, what type of study needs to be done \\ to establish that a change in dosage causes a change in T4 cell \\levels? 
\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=2cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item correlational study
\item controlled experiment
\item prediction study
\item survey
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Try to avoid repetitious/tedious calculations on exams that may become the focus of the problem for the students at the expense of concepts and interpretations.}}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 13}}}
It was claimed 
\marginnote{\textit{Critique: This problem requires use of software to calculate the exact binomial or use of the binomial approximation to the normal.  Computer output might be provided to augment this question and facilitate solution.}}
that 1 out of 5 cardiologists takes an aspirin a day to prevent hardening of the arteries.  Suppose the claim is true.  If 1,500 cardiologists are selected at random, what is the probability that at least 275 of the 1,500 take an aspirin a day? 

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 14}}}

A first-year program course 
\marginnote{\textit{Critique: The version of the question above requires a fair amount of pounding on the calculator to get the results and never even asks for an interpretation.  The revision below still requires some calculation (which can be adjusted depending on the amount of computer output provided) but the calculations can be done relatively efficiently---especially by students who have a good sense of what the computer output is providing.}}%
used a final exam that contained a 20-point essay question asking students to apply Darwinian principles to analyze the process of expansion in major league sports franchises.

\section{\textbf{Additional Examples of Good Assessment Items}}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 15}}}
A study found that individuals who lived in houses with more than two bathrooms tended to have higher blood pressure than individuals who lived in houses with two or fewer bathrooms.  Can cause-and-effect be determined from this?  Why or why not?

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 16}}}
Researchers took random samples of subjects from two populations and applied a test to the data; the \textit{p}-value for the test, using a nondirectional alternative, was 0.06.  For each of the following, say whether the statement is true or false and why.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item There is a 6\% chance that the two population distributions really are the same.
\item If the two population distributions really are the same, then a difference between the two samples as extreme as the difference that these researchers observed would only happen 6\% of the time.
\item If a new study were done that compared the two populations, there is a 6\% probability that $H_0$ would be rejected again.
\item If $\alpha = 0.05$ and a directional alternative were used, and the data departed from $H_0$ in the direction specified by the alternative hypothesis, then $H_0$ would be rejected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 17}}}

As the name suggests, the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National
Park has eruptions that come at fairly predictable intervals, making
it particularly attractive to tourists.  Here is a boxplot of the times
between eruptions recorded by an observer.

\noindent
\includegraphics[width=3.2in]{includes/faithful1.png}
   \hspace*{.10in}\includegraphics[width=1.3in]{includes/old-faithful.jpg}

\noindent
You are a busy tourist and have only 10 minutes to sit around and
watch the geyser.  But you can choose when to arrive.  If the last
eruption occurred at noon, what time should you arrive at the geyser
to maximize your chances of seeing an eruption?
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.1em]
\item 12:50pm
\item 1:00pm
\item 1:05pm
\item 1:15pm
\item 1:25pm
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Roughly, what is the probability that in the best 10-minute interval,
you will actually see the eruption:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=0em]
\item 5\%
\item 10\%
\item 20\%
\item 30\%
\item 50\%
\item 75\%
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
A simple measure of how faithful is Old Faithful is the interquartile
range.  What is the interquartile range, according to the
boxplot above?
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=0em]
\item 10 minutes
\item 15 minutes
\item 25 minutes
\item 35 minutes
\item 50 minutes
\item 75 minutes
\end{enumerate}

Not only are you a busy tourist, you are a smart tourist.  Having read
about Old Faithful, you understand that the time between eruptions
depends on how long the previous eruption lasted.   Here's a box
plot indicating the distribution of inter-eruption times when the
previous eruption duration was less than three minutes.  

\noindent
\includegraphics[width=4.2in]{includes/faithful2.png}

You can easily ask the ranger what was the duration of the previous
eruption. 

What is the best 10-minute interval to return (after a noon eruption)
so that you will be most likely to see the next eruption, given that
the previous eruption was less than three minutes in duration?

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.1em]
\item 12:30 to 12:40
\item 12:40 to 12:50
\item 12:50 to 1:00
\item 1:15 to 1:25
\item 1:25 to 1:35
\end{enumerate}


\noindent
How likely are you to see an eruption if you return for the most
likely 10-minute interval?

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.1em]
\item About 5\%
\item About 10\%
\item About 20\%
\item About 30\%
\item About 50\%
\item About 75\%
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 18}}}
An article on the CNN web page begins with the sentence, ``Family doctors overwhelmingly believe that religious faith can help patients heal, according to a survey released Monday.''  Later, the article states, ``Medical researchers say the benefits of religion may be as simple as helping the immune system by reducing stress,'' and Dr. Harold Koenig is reported to say that ``people who regularly attend church have half the rate of depression of infrequent churchgoers.''
  
Use the language of statistics to critique the statement by Dr.\ Koenig and the claim, suggested by the article, that religious faith and practice help people fight depression. You will want to select some of the following words in your critique: observational study, experiment, blind, double-blind, precision, bias, sample, spurious, confounding, causation, association, random, valid, reliable.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 19}}}
A student weighed 100 industrial diamonds.  She found that the sample average weight was 4.80 grams and the SD was 0.28 grams. \textit{In the context of this setting,} explain what is meant by the sampling distribution of an average.

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 20}}}
A gardener wishes to compare the yields of three types of pea seeds---type A, type B, and type C.  She randomly divides the type A seeds into three groups and plants some in the east part of her garden, some in the central part of the garden, and some in the west part of the garden.  Then, she does the same with the type B seeds and type C seeds.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item \textit{What kind} of experimental design is the gardener using?
\item \textit{Why} is this kind of design used in this situation?  (Explain in the \textit{context of the situation.})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 21}}}
The scatterplot shows how divorce rate, y, and marriage rate, x, are related for a collection of 10 countries.  The regression line has been added to the plot.

\begin{marginfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics{includes/Item13_R.pdf}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item The U.S. is not one of the 10 points in the original collection of countries.  It happens that the U.S. has a higher marriage rate than any of the 10 countries.  Moreover, the divorce rate for the U.S. is higher than one would expect, given the pattern of the other countries.  How would adding the U.S. to the data set affect the regression line?  Why?
\item Think about the scatterplot and regression line after the U.S. has been added to the data set.  Provide a sketch of the residual plot.  Label the axes and identify the U.S. on your plot with a triangle.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 22}}}
Researchers wanted to compare two drugs, formoterol and salbutamol, in aerosol solution to a placebo for the treatment of patients who suffer from exercise-induced asthma.  Patients were to take a drug or the placebo, do some exercise, and then have their ``forced expiratory volume'' measured.  There were 30 subjects available. 
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Should this be an experiment or an observational study?  Why?
\item Within the context of this setting, what is the placebo effect?
\item Briefly explain how to set up a randomized blocks design (RBD) here.
\item How would an RBD be helpful?  That is, what is the main advantage of using an RBD in a setting like this?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 23}}}
For each of the following three settings, state the type of analysis you would conduct (e.g., one-sample \textit{t}-test, regression, chi-square test of independence, chi-square goodness-of-fit test, etc.) if you had all the raw data and specify the roles of the variable(s) on which you would perform the analysis, but \textit{do not actually carry out the analysis}.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item A student measured the effect of exercise on pulse for each of 13 students.  She measured pulse before and after exercise (doing 30 jumping jacks) and found that the average change was 55.1 and the SD of the changes was 18.4.  How would you analyze the data?
\item Three HIV treatments were tested for their effectiveness in preventing progression of HIV in children.  Of 276 children given drug A, 259 lived and 17 died. Of 281 children given drug B, 274 lived and seven died.  Of 274 children given drug C, 264 lived and 10 died.  How would you analyze the data?
\item A researcher was interested in the relationship between blood pressure and physical activity.
He measured the blood pressure and weekly total number of steps from a Fitbit for 125 women.
How would you analyze these data?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 24}}}
I constructed
parallel dotplots of the data from four samples.  I then conducted a test of $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4$ and rejected $H_0$ at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.  I also tested $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3$ and rejected $H_0$ at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.  However, when I tested $H_0: \mu_2=\mu_3$ using $\alpha = 0.05$, I did \textit{not} reject $H_0$.  Likewise, when I tested $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_4$ using $\alpha = 0.05$, I did \textit{not} reject $H_0$.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Your job is to sketch a graph of the parallel dotplots of the data. That is, based on what I told you about the tests, you should have an idea of how the data look. Use that idea to draw a graph.  Indicate the sample means with triangles that you add to the dotplots.
\item It is possible to get data with the same sample means that you graphed in part 1, but for which the hypothesis $H_0: \mu_1=\mu_2=\mu_3=\mu_4$ is not rejected at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.  Provide a graph of this situation.  That is, keep the same sample means (triangles) you had from part 1, but show how the data would have been different if $H_0$ were not to be rejected.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 25}}}
A student collected data on a random sample of 12 breakfast cereals.  They recorded x = fiber (in grams/ounce) and y = price (in cents/ounce).  A scatterplot of the data shows a linear relationship.  The fitted regression model is

\begin{equation*}
\hat{y} = 17.42 + 0.62x
\end{equation*}
  
The sample correlation coefficient, $r$, is 0.23.  The SE of $b_1$ is 0.81.   Also, $s_{y|x}$ = 3.1.
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item Find $r^2$ and interpret $r^2$ in the context of this problem.
\item Suppose a cereal has 2.63 grams of fiber/ounce and costs 17.3 cents/ounce.  What is the residual for this cereal?
\item Interpret the value of $s_{y|x}$ in the context of this problem.  That is, what does it mean to say that $s_{y|x}$ = 3.1?
\item In the context of this problem, explain what is meant by ``the regression effect.''

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 27}}}
Identify whether a scatterplot would or would not be an appropriate visual summary of the relationship between the variables.  In each case, explain your reasoning.  
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]

\item Every week during the Vietnam War, a body count (number of enemy killed) was reported by each army unit. The last digits of these numbers should be fairly random.  However, suspicions arose that the counts might have been fabricated.  To test this, a large random sample of body count figures was examined and the frequency with which the last digit was a 0 or a 5 was recorded.  Psychologists have shown that people making up their own random numbers will use these digits less often than random chance would suggest (i.e., 103 sounds like a more ``real" count than 100).  If the data were authentic counts, the proportion of numbers ending in 0 or 5 should be about 0.20.  (\textit{p}-value=0.002)

A terse report of a statistical test is given below:
\begin{quote}
The P-value for a hypothesis test with hypotheses $H_0: \mu = 3$ versus $H_1: \mu \neq 3$ is 0.04.
\end{quote}

Critique the following responses for clarity, completeness  and correctness.

\begin{enumerate} [leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=.2em]
\item This means that the probability of getting our test statistic is 0.04.

\item This means that the probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as ours is 0.04.

\item This means that if the null hypothesis is true, the probability of getting a test statistics at least as extreme as ours is 0.04

\item This means that if the null hypothesis is true, the probability of getting a test statistic less than or equal to the one we got is 0.04

\item This means that it is very unlikely that the result that was used to compute this P-value would have happened by pure chance alone, assuming that  H0 is true. Therefore we could conclude that the evidence is against the Null Hypothesis , and H0 is probably  not true.

\item The sentence means that assuming the population average is equal to three, the likelihood of getting an average as large or larger than we got for our sample is about 4 percent. 

\item The p-value is the probability that the data will be as extreme or more extreme as the alternate hypothesis suggests.

\item A 99\% confidence interval is used to show that 99\% of the time when you pick a sample from the population  (students having between 45 and 60 credit hours) you will find a mean GPA in the interval (2.25, 2.75).

\item 
There is a 99\% chance that $2.25 \leq \mu \leq  2.75$.

Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.

Determine if each of the following statements is true or false. If false, explain why. \textit{Be careful:} The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.
\begin{itemize}
\item Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.
\item The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.
\item The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
\item Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

\item If the type of treatment and having cardiovascular problems were independent (null hypothesis), about how many patients in the rosiglitazone group would we expect to have had cardiovascular problems?
\item We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique.  While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the null hypothesis, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 10,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems. Below is a relative frequency histogram of these counts.
\item What are the claims being tested?
\item Compared to the number calculated in the second part, which would provide more support for the alternative hypothesis,  \textit{more} or \textit{fewer} patients with cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group?
\item What do the simulation results suggest about the relationship between taking rosiglitazone and having cardiovascular problems in diabetic patients?

\item One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is effective is to use a randomization technique.
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the claims being tested? Use the same null and alternative hypothesis notation used in the section.
\item  The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate.
We write \textit{alive} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and \textit{dead} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of \textit{dead} cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this many times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.
\item What do the simulation results shown below suggest about the effectiveness of the transplant program?

\subsection{\textbf{\textit{Item 54}}}


Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment compared to symptomatic treatment for acute sinusitis randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with sinusitis into two groups (as discussed in Exercise~\ref{sinusitis}). Participants in the antibiotic group received a 10-day course of an antibiotic, and the rest received symptomatic treatments as a placebo. These pills had the same taste and packaging as the antibiotic. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the study. The distribution of responses is summarized below. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Self-reported}} \\
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{improvement in symptoms}} \\
\cline{3-4}
			&							& Yes 	& No 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
							&Antibiotic 	& 66	 	& 19		& 85 	\\
\raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\textit{Treatment}}	& Placebo		& 65	 	& 16 	 	& 81 \\
\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 131	& 35		& 166
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item What type of a study is this?
\item Does this study make use of blinding?
\item Compute the difference in the proportions of patients who self-reported an improvement in symptoms in the two groups: $\hat{p}_{antibiotic} - \hat{p}_{placebo}$.
\item At first glance, does antibiotic or placebo appear to be more effective for the treatment of sinusitis? Explain your reasoning using appropriate statistics.
\item There are two competing claims that this study is used to compare: the null hypothesis that the antibiotic has no impact and the alternative hypothesis that it has an impact. Write out these competing claims in easy-to-understand language and in the context of the application.
\item Below is a histogram of simulation results computed under the null hypothesis. In each simulation, the summary value reported was the number of patients who received antibiotics and self-reported an improvement in symptoms. Write a conclusion for the hypothesis test in plain language. (Hint: Does the value observed in the study, 66, seem unusual in this distribution generated under the null hypothesis?)

\section{\textbf{Examples of Assessments for Presentations and Projects}}

Projects and presentations are an increasingly 
\marginnote{Halvorsen (ICOTS, 2010, \url{http://iase-web.org/documents/papers/icots8/ICOTS8_4G3_HALVORSEN.pdf} provides motivation for the use of projects as well as details of specific deliverables.}
common component of introductory statistics courses.  
 Projects provide an opportunity for 
students to learn statistics by doing statistics.  They demonstrate that statistical practice includes
formulating a statistical question, designing a plan for collecting relevant data, using appropriate
statistical methods for analyzing the data, and presenting results in a public setting such as a poster,
oral presentation, or a paper (Halvorsen, ICOTS 2010). 
Students have the opportunity to 
develop statistical questions that arise from broader research questions, to design data
analysis plans, and to communicate results.
We provide a basic rubric for presentations and projects along with a sample numeric grading scheme.

\begin{tabular}{| p{4cm} | p{4cm} | p{4cm} | p{4cm} |}
\hline
% X & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Achievement Level}\\
 Core Competency &  Needs Improvement & Basic & Surpassed \\
 \hline
 \hline		
\textbf{Computation}
Perform computations &
Computations contain errors and extraneous code &
Computations are correct but contain extraneous/unnecessary computations	&
Computations are correct and properly identified and labeled \\
 \hline
\textbf{Analysis}
Choose and carry out analysis appropriate for data and context	 &
Choice of analysis is overly simplistic, irrelevant, or missing key component &
Analysis appropriate, but incomplete, or not important features and assumptions not made explicit &
 Analysis appropriate, complete, advanced, relevant, and informative \\
  \hline
\textbf{Synthesis}
Identify key features of the analysis, and interpret results (including context) &
 Conclusions are missing, incorrect, or not made based on results of analysis &
 Conclusions reasonable, but is partially correct or partially complete &
 Make relevant conclusions explicitly connected to analysis and to context \\
  \hline
\textbf{Visual presentation}
Communicate findings graphically clearly, precisely, and concisely  & 
 Inappropriate choice of plots; poorly labeled plots; plots missing &
 Plots convey information correctly but lack context for interpretation &
 Plots convey information correctly with adequate/appropriate reference information \\
  \hline
\textbf{Verbal}
Communicate findings in writing clearly, precisely, and concisely &
 Explanation is illogical, incorrect, or incoherent. &
 Explanation is partially correct but incomplete or unconvincing	&
 Explanation is correct, complete, and convincing \\

If needed, the competencies can be converted into a numeric score. 
One might begin by giving a score of 85 for achieving basic competency in all 5 categories.
Then we add to this score for competencies that surpass the basic level and subtract for 
those that need improvement.
Three points might be added (subtracted) for each of the first three competencies that 
have surpassed the basic (need improvement), with
four points added (subtracted) for the fourth competency that is surpassed (needs improvement) 
and five points for the fifth competency. 
In other words, it is increasingly challenging to surpass the basic competency, 
and it is increasingly problematic to not achieve basic competency.
For example, if all five competencies
are rated ``surpassed", the score is $85 + 3*3 +4 + 5 = 100$; 
if 4 competencies are rated ``surpassed" and the fifth is ``basic" then the score is $85 + 3*3 +4 = 95$;  and for 3  ``surpassed", 1 
``needs improvement", and 1 ``basic", the score is $85 + 3*3 - 3 = 91$.
If a competency is missing, then 15 points are subtracted regardless of how many 
competencies are categorized as needing improvement.
