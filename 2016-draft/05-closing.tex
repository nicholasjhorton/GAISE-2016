\section{\textbf{GAISEing into the Future}}
 
\newthought{A good deal of progress has been made}, but there is still plenty of room to improve the introductory statistics course. Moreover, this course must be flexible and adapt to change as more students enter college having learned aspects of statistics in elementary and secondary school. The Advanced Placement course continues to change the statistics education landscape. Although we have been addressing the general introductory course, we must be mindful of other courses, such as business statistics and mathematical statistics, and of the content and goals of good second courses in statistics that build on the solid conceptual understanding developed in the first course.
